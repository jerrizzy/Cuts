# Cuts is made to help you find your favorite barbers.

The goal is to lessen the risk that comes with choosing a barber. 

One can search for barbers and determine if a barber is the right choice based on reviews and ratings.

The project has a client-side directory for the frontend which uses React, and CSS.
For the backend, it has a server folder that uses Flask, and SQLalchemy.

The front end uses a Google map API to pinpoint barbers' locations on a map.

SQLalchemy is used to store barbers' information and clients' information in the database.
If signed up as a barber, the user can create or add his information as a barber with POST request.
